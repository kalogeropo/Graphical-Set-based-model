# Graphical-Set-based model
My thessis on creating a new information retrieval model representing textual documents as graphs, considering node importance, the retrieval proccess is handled by the set based model. For more information:  https://rdcu.be/b8Y1S

This is the code for the paper "**A Graph-Based Extension for the Set-Based Model Implementing Algorithms Based on Important Nodes**" presented on _Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, AIAI 2020 IFIP WG 12.5 International Workshops_.

## Implementation - Description

## Dataset

As expirimental dataset the Cystic Fibrosis collection was used (REF: http://www2.dcc.ufmg.br/livros/irbook/cfc.html ). The CF collection consists of 1239 documents-articles, including author, refrences, abstract and more information. Also it includes 100 queries and the most relevant documents for each query. The ranking proccess handled by experts using "a grade" ranking proccess.
