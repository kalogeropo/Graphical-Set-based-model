# Graphical-Set-based model
My thessis on creating a new information retrieval model representing textual documents as graphs, considering node importance, the retrieval proccess is handled by the set based model. For more information:  https://rdcu.be/b8Y1S

This is the code for the paper "**A Graph-Based Extension for the Set-Based Model Implementing Algorithms Based on Important Nodes**" presented on _Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, AIAI 2020 IFIP WG 12.5 International Workshops_.
